### README

The `CMEECourseWork` repository contains files organized into four weeks of coursework. Each week's directory is further divided into the following subfolders:

- **`code`**: Contains all scripts and LaTeX files.
- **`results`**: Stores the output generated by the scripts, such as plots and CSV files.
- **`sandbox`**: Serves as a workspace for experimental or draft code.
- **`data`**: Includes all necessary input datasets and files required for the scripts.

### Important Note on Relative Paths
When running any scripts from this repository, please ensure that your working directory is correctly set to the `code` folder of the specific week you are working on. This is crucial because relative paths are used throughout the scripts, and incorrect paths will cause errors in accessing the required files.

### Special Note on Week 4
In the `week4/code` folder, there is a LaTeX report that references the `1.png` image file located in `week4/data`. To prevent issues with image loading, I have included a pre-generated PDF of the report (`week4/code/report.pdf`) for your convenience and reference. You can view this file directly without compiling the LaTeX document.

Please ensure you follow the folder structure and path conventions to smoothly run and interpret the scripts and reports within this repository. Let me know if you have any questions or issues!
