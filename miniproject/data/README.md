## 📄 Contents
- **`LogisticGrowthData.csv`**: The primary dataset used in the project, containing microbial growth measurements over time.

## 🔍 Data Description
The dataset includes the following key columns:
- `Time` ⏳: The time points at which microbial population data was recorded.
- `PopBio` 🦠: The observed microbial population at each corresponding time point.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- This dataset is essential for running the scripts in the `code/` directory.
- Ensure this file remains unmodified unless preprocessing is explicitly required.
- If additional datasets are used in the future, update this README accordingly.
