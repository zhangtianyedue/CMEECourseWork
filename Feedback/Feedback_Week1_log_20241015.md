# Feedback on Project Structure and Code

## Project Structure

### Repository Organization
The repository is well-structured, with clearly defined directories for `code`, `data`, `results`, and `sandbox`, which is a good practice for separating tasks and outputs. However, the `.gitignore` file is missing. Adding this file would help to keep unnecessary or system files like `.DS_Store` from being tracked in version control.

### README Files
The `README.md` file provides a brief overview of the project structure but could be enhanced with more detailed instructions on how to run each script, including specific examples of input and output files. The mention of using relative paths is good but could be further clarified for users unfamiliar with the workflow.

## Workflow
The workflow is well-organized, and the code, data, and results are separated into their respective directories. The results directory is appropriately empty, as outputs should generally not be tracked in version control. Adding a `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary or large files (e.g., results) would help keep the repository clean.

## Code Syntax & Structure

### Shell Scripts
1. **UnixPrac1.txt:**
   - The script performs various UNIX commands for handling `.fasta` files and is well-structured. However, it would benefit from more comments explaining each command step-by-step for better readability and understanding. It’s a good idea to save output results directly to the `results` folder.

2. **boilerplate.sh:**
   - This simple script prints a basic message. It runs without issues and serves as a good example of a basic shell script template.

3. **CountLines.sh:**
   - This script checks for the correct number of arguments and counts the number of lines in files. Error handling is properly implemented when no file is provided or when a file does not exist. No major improvements are necessary, but it might help to provide the option to handle multiple file types (not just text files).

4. **csvtospace.sh:**
   - This script converts CSV files into space-separated files. It handles input validation well, ensuring the file exists and is formatted correctly. However, the script could check if the output file already exists to avoid overwriting without warning.

5. **tabtocsv.sh:**
   - This script converts tab-delimited files to CSV format. The input validation is thorough, but the error message could be clearer. Instead of simply rejecting files that are not `.csv`, the script should be more specific about the input format required.

6. **variables.sh:**
   - This script demonstrates the use of variables, including handling user input and performing arithmetic operations. However, it uses `expr` for arithmetic, which is outdated. You should replace it with `$((...))`:
     ```bash
     MY_SUM=$(($a + $b))
     ```
   - This improves compatibility and readability.

7. **ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh:**
   - This script concatenates two input files into a third file, handling input validation well. It’s a good practice to include a check that prevents overwriting the output file unless confirmed by the user, which you’ve already implemented. Overall, the script works as expected.

8. **tiff2png.sh:**
   - The script converts `.tif` files to `.png` format. While the logic is sound, the script fails when no `.tif` files are found. Adding a check for the existence of `.tif` files before attempting the conversion would prevent this issue:
     ```bash
     if compgen -G "*.tif" > /dev/null; then
         # Conversion code here
     else
         echo "No .tif files found."
     fi
     ```

### Other Code Considerations
- The overall structure of the scripts is solid, and input validation is consistently applied across the scripts. This is a good practice that prevents errors during execution.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- **Error Handling:** Across the scripts, adding checks for file existence before writing output files would prevent overwriting and missing file errors.
- **Modernization:** Replace outdated practices like using `expr` for arithmetic with `$((...))` to improve compatibility with modern shell scripting practices.
- **Comments:** Some scripts could benefit from more detailed comments, especially in `UnixPrac1.txt`, to make the code easier to understand for someone unfamiliar with it.
- **README Enhancements:** Including more detailed usage instructions, examples of expected input and output, and any system dependencies would improve usability.

## Overall Feedback
The project is well-structured, and the scripts are functional and demonstrate good practices. With minor improvements in error handling, script modernization, and more detailed README documentation, the project would be even more robust and user-friendly. Overall, it reflects a solid understanding of shell scripting and project organization.
