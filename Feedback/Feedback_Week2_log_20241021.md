# Feedback for Tianye on Project Structure, Workflow, and Python Code

## Project Structure and Workflow

### General Structure
- **Repository Layout**: The project is well-structured with separate weekly directories (`Week1`, `Week2`, `Week3`). Inside each week, the use of `code`, `data`, `results`, and `sandbox` directories helps maintain a clean and organized workflow.
- **README Files**: Both the root-level and weekly README files are included, but more details would be helpful:
  - **Dependencies**: The README file mentions that no dependencies are required, yet some scripts import external libraries (e.g., `fuzzywuzzy` in `oaks_debugme.py`). Make sure to include these dependencies in the README or use a `requirements.txt` file to allow users to install the necessary packages.
  - **Usage Instructions**: Add more specific examples in the README on how to run each script, especially those using command-line arguments like `align_seqs.py`. This will guide users on how to input data and what to expect in terms of output.

### Workflow
- **Results Directory**: It’s good to see a dedicated `results` folder for storing output files. However, in general, this directory should remain empty in version control (except perhaps for a `.gitkeep` file). The results should be generated dynamically during script execution.
- **Sandbox Directory**: The sandbox directory is currently empty. Ensure it’s used for experimental scripts and temporary files, and move any finalized scripts to the `code` directory once they are ready for production. Better still, `.gitignore` it. 

## Python Code Feedback

### General Code Quality
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: The code mostly follows Python's standards, but there are some minor issues with indentation and spacing that should be corrected. Adhering strictly to PEP 8 will improve readability and maintainability.
- **Docstrings**: Some scripts lack detailed docstrings. Each function and script should have a docstring that clearly explains its purpose, parameters, and expected outputs. The absence of script-level docstrings in several files is noted and should be added.
- **Error Handling**: There are several instances where files are assumed to exist (e.g., in `align_seqs.py` and `oaks_debugme.py`). Adding error handling to check for file existence and handle potential errors (e.g., missing or improperly formatted files) would make the code more robust.

### Detailed Code Review

#### `oaks_debugme.py`
- **Docstrings**: The function `is_an_oak` includes a docstring, which is great, but the script itself lacks a docstring. A script-level docstring explaining the overall purpose of the script is necessary.
- **Error Handling**: The script depends on the external library `fuzzywuzzy`, which isn't listed in the README. It would also benefit from better error handling around file reading and writing operations to ensure robustness when the expected file (`TestOaksData.csv`) is missing or incorrectly formatted.

#### `align_seqs.py`
- **Modularization**: The sequence alignment logic is solid but could be broken down into smaller, more modular functions. This would improve readability and make it easier to maintain and debug.
- **Docstrings**: None of the functions in this script have docstrings. Add function-level docstrings to explain the inputs, outputs, and behavior.
- **Error Handling**: Adding file existence checks and proper error messages for missing or malformed input files would make the code more user-friendly.

#### `dictionary.py`
- **Optimization**: The dictionary creation logic works, but it could be optimized by using Python's `defaultdict` from the `collections` module for improved efficiency and readability.
- **Docstrings**: The script lacks a script-level docstring. Adding this will help explain the script’s purpose and functionality.

#### `cfexercises1.py`
- **Redundancy**: The script includes multiple implementations for calculating factorials (`foo_4`, `foo_5`, `foo_6`). These functions could be refactored to reduce redundancy and improve clarity while still demonstrating different approaches (iterative vs recursive).
- **Docstrings**: This script has some docstrings, but they could be expanded to provide more detail, especially in the function-level docstrings.

#### `lc1.py`, `lc2.py`
- **Docstrings**: These scripts provide good examples of list comprehensions and loops, but they lack both script-level and function-level docstrings. Adding these will improve understanding and maintainability.
  
#### `debugme.py`
- **Debugging Tools**: This script uses the `ipdb` library for debugging, which is a good practice. However, `ipdb` should be included as a dependency in the README or a `requirements.txt` file. Additionally, more comments and docstrings explaining the debugging process would be helpful for educational purposes.

### Final Remarks
The project demonstrates a solid understanding of Python, including control flow, list comprehensions, and file handling. However, there are some areas for improvement:
1. Ensure that all functions and scripts have detailed docstrings.
2. Add robust error handling for file operations and missing dependencies.
3. Refactor redundant code to improve readability and maintainability.
