This is my ***second week's assignment***.

In the 'code' folder, some of the Python code I wrote is stored.
The 'data' folder contains two datasets.
The 'result' folder is used to store the output results of the code. 
The 'sandbox' folder is temporarily empty and will be used for testing some code in the future. 

***Detailed explanations will be provided in the README files of each respective section.***
