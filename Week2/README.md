# Week 2 Assignment

## Overview

This is the second week's assignment for the course. The project structure is organized as follows:

- **`code` folder**: Contains Python scripts written for this week's assignment.
- **`data` folder**: Includes two datasets used as inputs for the scripts in the `code` folder.
- **`result` folder**: Designed to store the output generated by the scripts.
- **`sandbox` folder**: Currently empty but reserved for testing and experimentation with additional code in the future.

Detailed explanations for each section are provided in the respective `README.md` files.

## Update History

### Update (05/12/2024 - 11:30)
This revision addresses feedback from the previous submission. Key improvements include:

1. **Comprehensive Docstrings**: Added detailed docstrings to critical functions and scripts for better clarity and accessibility.
2. **Code Modularization**: Refactored scripts to improve structure and maintainability.
3. **Simplified Output Formatting**: Enhanced the clarity of output results to make them more readable.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Reduced redundant code to improve efficiency and maintainability.
5. **Improved Readability**: Adopted better naming conventions and formatted code to align with best practices.

These changes make the scripts more user-friendly and easier to understand for both users and reviewers.

### Update (06/12/2024 - 01:15)
Given that the system used is macOS, I have implemented a workaround to bypass certain limitations of Homebrew by using a virtual environment to install required dependencies. The steps are as follows:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install Required Modules**:
   ```bash
   pip install fuzzywuzzy
   ```
4. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python3 oaks_debugme.py
   ```
5. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

This ensures an isolated environment for dependencies and avoids potential conflicts with system-wide installations.

## Notes

1. This assignment reflects ongoing improvements based on feedback to ensure a polished and robust submission.
2. Further updates and testing will be conducted in the `sandbox` folder as new features or experiments are introduced.
