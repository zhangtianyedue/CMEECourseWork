This is my ***second week's assignment***.

In the 'code' folder, some of the Python code I wrote is stored.

The 'data' folder contains two datasets.
The 'result' folder is used to store the output results of the code. 
The 'sandbox' folder is temporarily empty and will be used for testing some code in the future. 

***Detailed explanations will be provided in the README files of each respective section.***

In this revision, I have addressed the previous feedback regarding the lack of script-level docstrings in critical parts of my scripts. I have added comprehensive docstrings to the relevant functions to make the scripts more accessible and easier to understand for readers. Additionally, I have implemented several improvements, including code modularization for better structure, simplified output formatting for clarity, enhanced readability, and reduced redundant code to optimize overall performance and maintainability. These changes aim to make my scripts more user-friendly and efficient.

because im using the Macos system,to bypass the limitations of Homebrew, I create a virtual environment to install the required dependencies. The steps are as follows:
1.Create a virtual environment:
bash
python3 -m venv myenv
2.Activate the virtual environment:
bash
source myenv/bin/activate
3.Install the required module:
bash
pip install fuzzywuzzy
4.Run my script:
python3 oaks_debugme.py
5.exit the virtual enviroment 
deactivate
