#The 'code' folder contains a total of 7 Python files. 

Among them, **lc1.py**, **lc2.py**, **dictionary.py**, and **tuple.py** are the code for the first question. In this task, I used **two different** methods to complete the assignment. 
For example, when writing the loop, I first used the For method and then the while method, as I believe this will help improve my programming skills. 

The code for the second question is **cfexercises1.py**, in which I added some test arguments to show that they work. I also included the test results I obtained in the command section.

The code for the third question is named** align_seqs.py**. Please note that when running this file, make sure you are in the **week2/code directory**, as I used relative paths when importing files. The file being imported is named **sequences.csv**, which is located in the**week2/data** folder. The final result will be directly written to the week2/results folder, with the filename **sequences_results.csv**


The code for the fourth question is named **oaks_debugme.py**. Please note that when running this file, make sure you are in the **week2/code** directory, as I used relative paths when importing files. The file being imported is named **TestOaksData.csv**, which is located in the **week2/data** folder. The final result will be directly written to the **week2/results** folder, with the filename **oak_result.csv**.
