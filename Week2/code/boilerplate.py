"""
This script serves as a boilerplate template for Python programs, providing a standard structure 
that includes metadata, imports, constants, functions, and the main execution block.

Features:
1. Metadata: Includes placeholders for application name, author, version, and license.
2. Standard imports: Demonstrates importing Python's `sys` module for interacting with the operating system.
3. Functionality: Contains a `main` function that prints a placeholder message.
4. Command-line entry point: Ensures the script can be executed directly from the command line.

Purpose:
- To provide a reusable template for new Python projects.
- Demonstrates best practices for organizing and structuring Python scripts.

Usage:
- Customize the metadata fields, add constants, and expand the `main` function to implement specific functionality.
- Run the script directly from the command line to see the placeholder output.
