***WEEK4***
First and foremost, please note that I have used relative paths in this coding assignment. Therefore, to ensure the code runs correctly, make sure to set your working directory to `week4/code`. Otherwise, the files stored in the `data` folder will not be accessible.


In the file `PP_Regress.R`, I utilized packages such as **ggplot2** and **dplyr** for data visualization and manipulation. To ensure the smooth execution of the code, I included a section at the very beginning of the script that checks whether these required packages are installed on your system. If any of the necessary packages are missing, the script will automatically install them before proceeding. This approach ensures that all dependencies are resolved, allowing the subsequent code to run without issues. 

Please note that within the `code` folder, I have included a LaTeX report related to the `Florida.R` script. The report provides detailed analysis and visualizations generated from the script. 

The images in the report are referenced using **relative paths**, ensuring consistency with the folder structure. Therefore, it is crucial to set your working directory to `week4/code` when compiling the LaTeX document. Failing to do so may result in the images not being displayed correctly in the compiled report.

Ensure you have the necessary LaTeX setup to compile the document and verify that all required image files are present in the appropriate directories.
